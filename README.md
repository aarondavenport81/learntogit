Practicing a bit with Github, see what all the fuss is about.
Update 5/8/19: Haven't done much on Github since starting 5/5 or so. I have figured out how to enter the prompt into the terminal window to get data in JSON format. After figuring out how to do that, I realized I have some work to do on either side of that. The API call is the middle, earlier steps are building the call with the proper prompts, and later steps are putting the data in readable form. Maybe even doing some filtering or analysis with it. The new current plan is to learn how to build a simple web page the accepts prompts (which account, what category, time period, things like that) and submits the REST call. I'll probably need to learn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build that. JS will come in handy for working with the JSON data as well. I actually don't really care about the style of the webpage as much so CSS will probably be third on the totem pole. 
Alright, BHAG is to for real learn to code and maybe turn it into something to get paid for. Small, bald, achievable goal is to learn a little more about coding by figuring out how to do some simple REST calls to the YNAB api.
